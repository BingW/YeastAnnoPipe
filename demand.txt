1. Let's retain only the longest ORF when there are overlaps.

10 coding regions are completely contained in another coding region.

8 coding regions are completely contained in another coding region on the same strand.

2 coding regions are completely contained in another coding region, but on the opposite strand.

It is unusual to have coding regions completely contained within other
coding regions.  Please remove any coding regions which are incorrect.

2. They seem to only like name like this "Kre9p-like protein", so let's
just take the common name of the Scer gene and call the Skud gene
"Gal4p-like protein" or whatever the  current annotation is. If there is
not a common name, just use the systematic name like "Ypl248c-like
protein".

[2] We have reviewed your product names and there are still a large number
of names which are incorrect or should be revised.  Many of your product
names
are not acutal names but more like descriptions of the function.  We
prefer concise
product names.  The descriptive information should best be moved to a
note.

For example:
You have a large number of product names which begin with a protein name
followed by
a functional description.  For example: "Integral membrane protein
required for efficency of mating"
The product name should simply be integral membrane protein.  the
additional information
such as "required for efficency of mating" should be moved to a CDS note.
This same idea should be applied to all product names with funtional
inforamtion after the
product name.

Instead of "Member of the" product names please use the family name
followed by protein.
sor for example "Member of the ChAPs family of proteins" would be ChAPs
family protein.

Do not start a product name with one of three or one of two.  For
example: One of three repressible acid phosphatases
should simply be repressible acid phosphatase.

If it begins with protein involved in reverse the order.  For example:
Protein involved in RNA polymerase II transcription should be RNA
polymerase II transcription protein

Do not use protein of unknown function or protein of unassigned function
to begin
a product name.  Particularly as you usually include an actual function
right after.
For example: "Protein of unknown function involved in outer spore wall
organization"
It is not of unknown function if it is involved in outer spore wall
organization.
If you are unsure of this protein you could change the product name to
hypothetical
protein and move the rest "involved in outer spore wall organization" to
a CDS note.

Do not use terms such as homolog, paralog, ortholog, similarity to, etc.
in your
product names.  For example: "Protein with similarity to Kre9p" should be
"Kre9p-like protein"

3. Don't move the names to notes like they suggest. We don't really know
for certain that the genes function in the same way in Skud, so let's just
remove them and go with the boring names like in #2.
